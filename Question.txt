For these tasks, you will use the CreditDataset.csv comma-separated-value file provided which has 690 records in the data set. There are no missing values in the data. There are 13 attributes (columns in the data) and a final column representing the target class label (whether to allow the individual to have a credit card or to decline his or her application).

There are 6 numerical and 8 categorical attributes. You will use these as inputs for your regression models. The original character values have been changed to make them easy to use by an analytic algorithm. For example, Column 4 originally had one of three character labels: ‘p’, ‘g’, or ‘gg’. These have been changed to the values 1, 2 or 3.

The last column (Column 14) is the target you are trying to predict. The value of ‘1’ indicates that your organization should allow this individual to have a credit card. The value of ‘0’ indicates that this individual’s application should be rejected.

Carry out the following tasks:

Tasks
Load the “CreditData.csv” dataset and store it into a local Pandas frame variable named “CreditData” using the relevant command.
From within your Jupyter Notebook, display the contents of the “CreditData” variable. Set the last column (‘Target’) to be a nominal ‘label’, as this is what you will be trying to predict.
Save the modified data into a file named “CreditData_clean.csv”.
Build the linear regression model using the following steps:
Create two subsets of data – one half for training data and the other half for test data.
Train the linear regression model.
Evaluate the performance of the linear regression model using the test data and report this by means of any appropriate method(s) e.g. via a confusion matrix.
Repeat steps 4 – 5, but this time building a logistic regression model.  Are there any differences in performance between the two regression models?
